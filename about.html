                <h1>Candace Hurman</h1>

                <p>Candace Hurman is a mother of two kids and a full-time employee at the largest healthcare company in the world. Candace, however, enjoys the water more than being on land. Luckily, her background as a competitive swimmer has allowed her to offer swimming lessons to children as a side job, which she has been doing for almost 30 years now and hopes will become her full-time job one day.

                <p>Candace swam competitively for 12 years, winning awards and distinctions, including All-America in high school and college (second division). She also gained further experience working as a lifeguard for five years and as a swim coach for two.</p>
                    
                <p>Candace’s teaching method is a unique one. Unlike other swim coaches, she individualizes her training based on the child’s individual abilities. Although she believes in pushing children out of their comfort zone, she also acknowledges the importance of gaining their trust first, making them feel safe, and tailoring the result to the capabilities and needs of the child. Candace believes there is no sense in pushing a child out of their comfort zone if they are not prepared for it. Otherwise, kids grow afraid of the water.</p>
                    
                <p>Besides safety and learning, Candace wants children to have fun. She understands some children learn more in a setting where they are enjoying themselves, which is why some of her lessons may seem more like play rather than a regular class. Her lessons last about 20-30 minutes since kids move most of the time and grow tired quickly. You can be sure that those minutes will be well worth it. Especially once you see your kid swimming confidently.</p>
